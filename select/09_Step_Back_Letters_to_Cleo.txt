Appear and fade away, so far so good and I'll tell you the story this time.
Plan too far ahead, it's the same old thing. Finally kicking it out this time.
Tell me where were you? Now just where were you? When it really
Mattered, like this time? Staring down a haze it's supposed to be a better
Day but it doesn't really matter, not this time. Step back, step back just
Suppose you're where you're supposed to be now. Step down, step down off that
Pedestal and then maybe you'll see. Like that time we went back in time surface
Wounds could not scar that tough exterior far superior what were you? Appear
And fade away so far so good and i'll tell you the story this time. Planned too
Late again, it's the same old thing. Finally kicking it out this time. Step
Back, step back just
Suppose you're where you're supposed to be now. Step down, step down off that
Cutting block, and then maybe you'll see.
